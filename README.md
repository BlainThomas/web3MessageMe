# Web3MessageMe

This is a React app that sends and verifyies messages on the blockchain.

## Description 

Connect the wallet you would like to use and sign a message.

Send the message, the hash, and your address to a reciever. They are then
 able to verify it was sent from that wallet.

The uses cases of this would be to verify a request that is being made or
 was made in the past. This would allow verification of supplychains or
  request for fund transfers at a bank.
